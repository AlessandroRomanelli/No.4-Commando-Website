          <h3>Who were the real No.4 Commandos?</h3>
          <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Commandos" target="_blank">British Commandos</a> were formed during the Second World War in June 1940,
          following a request from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston
          Churchill, for a force that could carry out hard hitting attacks on German
          positions on any front.</p>

          <h3>What is this unit about?</h3>
          <p>Training in the Scottish Highlands to beach landings in Normandy to Norway,
          ambushing enemies using iconic gear, weapons and vehicles provided by the
          mods we use as well as our own exclusive content. Sniper nests in clock
          towers to concrete pillbox's on open fields with para-drops into flak
          filled skies. The missions and scenarios are endless and we aim to replicate
          the conflict as closely to real life as possible whilst also keeping the
          relaxed aspect.</p>

        <div class="third-about">
          <h3> What makes us stick out from all the other units? </h3>
          <p>We Commandos pride ourselves to define us as the old-school people that prefer to
          see the enemy directly through the iron sight of our bolt-action rifles
          rather than through some kind of high-power magnfication lens attached to an automatic rifle.
          We face death from up close and we sure are not afraid to do so. Does not matter how dirty
          the business, Commandos are known for doing it well.
